# Correlation vs Causation in Materials Engineering

## Objective
To understand the difference between correlation and causation using a materials science example and basic statistical tools.

## Problem Description
In materials engineering, variables often appear correlated. However, correlation alone does not confirm a physical cause–effect relationship. This project demonstrates how to analyze correlation and interpret it using physical reasoning.

## Methodology
- Simulated temperature and yield strength data
- Visualized data using a scatter plot
- Calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient
- Interpreted results using materials science principles

## Key Concept
- A **positive correlation** indicates that both variables increase together
- A **negative correlation** indicates that one variable increases while the other decreases
- A value close to **zero** indicates little or no linear correlation
- **Correlation does not imply causation**

## Physical Interpretation
Although a statistical correlation may exist, the relationship must be supported by physical mechanisms. In materials, factors such as microstructure, grain size, or processing conditions may influence properties beyond the observed correlation.

## Tools Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## Conclusion
This project highlights the importance of combining statistical analysis with engineering judgment. Correlation should always be evaluated alongside physical understanding before drawing conclusions.
